<h2>Number of Islands</h2>

<h3>Statement</h3>

<p>
  Given an <code>m x n</code> 2D binary grid <code>grid</code> which represents
  a map of <code>&#39;1&#39;</code>s (land) and <code>&#39;0&#39;</code>s
  (water), return <em>the number of islands</em>.
</p>

<p>
  An <strong>island</strong> is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting
  adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of
  the grid are all surrounded by water.

<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
 <strong>Input:</strong> grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
 ]
 <strong>Output:</strong> 1

<pre>
 <strong>Input:</strong> grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]

 <strong>Output:</strong> 3

<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><code>m == grid.length</code></li>
  <li><code>n == grid[i].length</code></li>
  <li><code>1 &lt;= m, n &lt;= 300</code></li>
  <li>
    <code>grid[i][j]</code> is <code>&#39;0&#39;</code> or
    <code>&#39;1&#39;</code>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Editorial</h3>

<p>
  The problem asks us to find the number of connected components (islands) in a
  2D grid. We can solve this using Depth-First Search (DFS). The main idea is to
  iterate through each cell in the grid. If a cell is land ('1'), we increment
  the island count and then use DFS to "sink" the entire island by marking all
  connected land cells as visited (e.g., by changing them to '0').

<h3>Solution</h3>

<pre>
 class Solution {
  public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
   if (grid == null || grid.length == 0) {
    return 0;
   }

   int numRows = grid.length;
   int numCols = grid[0].length;
   int numIslands = 0;

   for (int i = 0; i < numRows; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < numCols; j++) {
     if (grid[i][j] == '1') {
      numIslands++;
      dfs(grid, i, j);
     }
    }
   }

   return numIslands;
  }

  private void dfs(char[][] grid, int row, int col) {
   int numRows = grid.length;
   int numCols = grid[0].length;

   if (row < 0 || row >= numRows || col < 0 || col >= numCols || grid[row][col] == '0') {
    return;
   }

   grid[row][col] = '0'; // Mark as visited

   // Explore adjacent cells
   dfs(grid, row + 1, col);
   dfs(grid, row - 1, col);
   dfs(grid, row, col + 1);
   dfs(grid, row, col - 1);
  }
 }
