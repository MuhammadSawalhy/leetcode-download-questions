<h2>Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock</h2>

<h3>Statement</h3>

<p>
  You are given an array <code>prices</code> where <code>prices[i]</code> is the
  price of a given stock on the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> day.
</p>

<p>
  You want to maximize your profit by choosing a <strong>single day</strong> to
  buy one stock and choosing a <strong>different day in the future</strong> to
  sell that stock.
</p>

<p>
  Return <em>the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction</em>. If
  you cannot achieve any profit, return <code>0</code>.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
<strong>Output:</strong> 5
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong> In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <code>1 &lt;= prices.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>0 &lt;= prices[i] &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
  </li>

<h3>Solution</h3>

<h2>Intuition</h2>
<p>
  The problem aims to find the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and
  selling a stock. The given solution seems to follow a simple approach of
  iterating through the prices, keeping track of the minimum buying price, and
  updating the profit whenever a higher selling price is encountered.

  />
</p>
<h2>Approach</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Initialize variables <code>buy</code> with the first element of the prices
    array and <code>profit</code> as 0.
  </li>
  <li>Iterate through the prices starting from the second element.</li>
  <li>
    Update the <code>buy</code> variable if the current price is lower than the
    current buying price.
  </li>
  <li>
    Update the <code>profit</code> if the difference between the current price
    and the buying price is greater than the current profit.
  </li>
  <li>Return the final profit.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Kadane's Algorithm</h2>
<p>
  Kadane's Algorithm is a dynamic programming technique used to find the maximum
  subarray sum in an array of numbers. The algorithm maintains two variables:
  <code>max_current</code> represents the maximum sum ending at the current
  position, and <code>max_global</code> represents the maximum subarray sum
  encountered so far. At each iteration, it updates <code>max_current</code> to
  include the current element or start a new subarray if the current element is
  larger than the accumulated sum. The <code>max_global</code> is updated if
  <code>max_current</code> surpasses its value.
</p>
<h2>Relating with the Approach</h2>
<p>
  In the provided approach for finding the maximum profit in stock prices, the
  algorithm can be seen as a variation of Kadane's Algorithm. Instead of finding
  the maximum subarray sum directly, it focuses on finding the maximum positive
  difference between consecutive elements (prices) in the array.
</p>
<p>Here's how the approach relates to Kadane's Algorithm:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Initialization:</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      In Kadane's Algorithm, <code>max_current</code> and
      <code>max_global</code> are initialized to the first element of the array.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      In the stock profit approach, <code>buy</code> is initialized with the
      first element of the prices array, and <code>profit</code> is initialized
      to 0.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Iteration:</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Kadane's Algorithm iterates through the array, updating
      <code>max_current</code> based on the current element's value and deciding
      whether to start a new subarray.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The stock profit approach iterates through the prices array, updating
      <code>buy</code> when a lower price is encountered and treating the
      difference between the current price and <code>buy</code> as a potential
      profit.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Comparison and Update:</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Kadane's Algorithm compares and updates <code>max_current</code> and
      <code>max_global</code> at each iteration.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    The stock profit approach compares and updates <code>profit</code> whenever
    a positive difference between the current price and <code>buy</code> exceeds
    the current profit.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Complexity</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Time complexity: $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the prices array. The
    algorithm iterates through the array once.
  </li>
  <li>
    Space complexity: $O(1)$, as only a constant amount of extra space is used.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Code</h2>
<p>
  <code
    >java [] class Solution { public int maxProfit(int[] prices) { int buy =
    prices[0]; int profit = 0; for (int i = 1; i &lt; prices.length; i++) { if
    (prices[i] &lt; buy) { buy = prices[i]; } else if (prices[i] - buy &gt;
    profit) { profit = prices[i] - buy; } } return profit; } }</code

    (prices[i] - buy &gt; profit) { profit = prices[i] - buy; } } return profit;
    } };</code
