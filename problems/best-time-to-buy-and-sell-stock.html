<h2>Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock</h2>

<h3>Statement</h3>

<p>
  You are given an array <code>prices</code> where <code>prices[i]</code> is the
  price of a given stock on the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> day.
</p>

<p>
  You want to maximize your profit by choosing a <strong>single day</strong> to
  buy one stock and choosing a <strong>different day in the future</strong> to
  sell that stock.
</p>

<p>
  Return <em>the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction</em>. If
  you cannot achieve any profit, return <code>0</code>.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
<strong>Output:</strong> 5
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong> In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <code>1 &lt;= prices.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>0 &lt;= prices[i] &lt;= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Solution</h3>

<p>
  The problem can be solved by keeping track of the minimum price seen so far
  and the maximum profit that can be achieved. Iterate through the prices array,
  updating the minimum price if a smaller price is encountered. Calculate the
  profit by subtracting the minimum price from the current price. Update the
  maximum profit if the calculated profit is greater than the current maximum
  profit.
</p>

<p><strong>Complexity</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the prices array.</li>
  <li>
    Space complexity: O(1), as only a constant amount of extra space is used.
  </li>
</ul>

<pre><code>
class Solution {
 public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
  int buy = prices[0];
  int profit = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
   if (prices[i] < buy) {
    buy = prices[i];
   } else if (prices[i] - buy > profit) {
    profit = prices[i] - buy;
   }
  }
  return profit;
 }
}
</code></pre>
