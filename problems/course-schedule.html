<h2>Course Schedule</h2>

<h3>Statement</h3>

<p>
  There are a total of <code>numCourses</code> courses you have to take, labeled
  from <code>0</code> to <code>numCourses - 1</code>. You are given an array
  <code>prerequisites</code> where
  <code>prerequisites[i] = [a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that
  you <strong>must</strong> take course <code>b<sub>i</sub></code> first if you
  want to take course <code>a<sub>i</sub></code
  >.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    For example, the pair <code>[0, 1]</code>, indicates that to take course
    <code>0</code> you have to first take course <code>1</code>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Return <code>true</code> if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return
  <code>false</code>.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
 <strong>Input:</strong> numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
 <strong>Output:</strong> true
 <strong>Explanation:</strong> There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
 To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
 </pre
>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
 <strong>Input:</strong> numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
 <strong>Output:</strong> false
 <strong>Explanation:</strong> There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
 To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

  <li><code>1 &lt;= numCourses &lt;= 2000</code></li>

  <li><code>prerequisites[i].length == 2</code></li>
  <li>
    <code>0 &lt;= a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub> &lt; numCourses</code>

  <li>All the pairs prerequisites[i] are <strong>unique</strong>.</li>

<h3>Hints</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    This problem is equivalent to finding if a cycle exists in a directed graph.
    If a cycle exists, no topological ordering exists and therefore it will be
    impossible to take all courses.

<h3>Editorial</h3>

<p>
  The problem asks whether it is possible to finish all courses given a set of
  prerequisites. This is equivalent to detecting a cycle in a directed graph. If
  a cycle exists, it is impossible to finish all courses because you would be
  stuck in a circular dependency.
</p>

<p>
  We can use Depth-First Search (DFS) to detect cycles. The idea is to traverse
  the graph, marking each node as "visiting" while exploring its neighbors. If
  we encounter a node that is already marked as "visiting" during the DFS
  traversal, it indicates a cycle.
</p>

<p>The algorithm works as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Build an adjacency list to represent the graph, where each course is a node
    and each prerequisite represents a directed edge.
  </li>
  <li>
    Create an array <code>visited</code> to keep track of the status of each
    node during the DFS traversal. The states are:
    <ul>
      <li><code>0</code>: Not visited</li>
      <li><code>1</code>: Visiting (currently in the recursion stack)</li>
      <li><code>2</code>: Visited (already explored)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    For each course, if it has not been visited, start a DFS traversal from that
    course.
  </li>
  <li>
    During the DFS traversal, mark the current course as "visiting". Then,
    explore its neighbors. If any neighbor is also in the "visiting" state, it
    means we have found a cycle, and we return <code>false</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    After exploring all neighbors, mark the current course as "visited" and
    return <code>true</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    If we have explored all courses without finding a cycle, it means we can
    finish all courses, and we return <code>true</code>.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Solution</h3>

<pre>
 class Solution {
  public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
  List&lt;List&lt;Integer&gt;&gt; adj = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(numCourses);
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; numCourses; i++) {
  adj.add(new ArrayList&lt;&gt;());
  }

  for (int[] prerequisite : prerequisites) {
  adj.get(prerequisite[1]).add(prerequisite[0]);
  }

  int[] visited = new int[numCourses];

  for (int i = 0; i &lt; numCourses; i++) {
  if (visited[i] == 0) {
  if (!dfs(i, adj, visited)) {
  return false;
  }
  }
  }

  return true;
  }

  private boolean dfs(int course, List&lt;List&lt;Integer&gt;&gt; adj, int[] visited) {
  visited[course] = 1; // Visiting

  for (int neighbor : adj.get(course)) {
  if (visited[neighbor] == 1) {
  return false; // Cycle detected
  }
  if (visited[neighbor] == 0) {
  if (!dfs(neighbor, adj, visited)) {
  return false;
  }
  }
  }

  visited[course] = 2; // Visited
  return true;
  }
 }
