<h2>House Robber II</h2>

<h3>Statement</h3>

<p>
  You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each
  house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are
  <strong>arranged in a circle.</strong> That means the first house is the
  neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system
  connected, and&nbsp;<b
    >it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken
    into on the same night</b
  >.
</p>

<p>
  Given an integer array <code>nums</code> representing the amount of money of
  each house, return
  <em
    >the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight
    <strong>without alerting the police</strong></em
  >.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [2,3,2]
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [1,2,3,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> 4
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [1,2,3]
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><code>1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 100</code></li>
  <li><code>0 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 1000</code></li>
</ul>

<h3>Hints</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Since House[1] and House[n] are adjacent, they cannot be robbed together.
    Therefore, the problem becomes to rob either House[1]-House[n-1] or
    House[2]-House[n], depending on which choice offers more money. Now the
    problem has degenerated to the
    <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/description/"
      >House Robber</a
    >, which is already been solved.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Solution</h3>

<p>
  The problem is a variation of the classic "House Robber" problem. The key
  difference is that the houses are arranged in a circle, meaning the first and
  last houses are neighbors. This constraint forces us to consider two separate
  cases:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Rob houses from index 0 to n-2 (inclusive), excluding the last house.</li>
  <li>
    Rob houses from index 1 to n-1 (inclusive), excluding the first house.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  We then solve the "House Robber" problem for each of these cases and take the
  maximum of the two results. This approach ensures that we never rob both the
  first and last houses.

<pre>
class Solution {
    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        if (n == 1) {
            return nums[0];
        }
        return Math.max(robLinear(nums, 0, n - 2), robLinear(nums, 1, n - 1));
    }

    private int robLinear(int[] nums, int start, int end) {
        int rob1 = 0;
        int rob2 = 0;

        for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {
            int temp = Math.max(rob1 + nums[i], rob2);
            rob1 = rob2;
            rob2 = temp;
        }

        return rob2;
    }
}
</pre>
