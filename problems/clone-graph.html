<h2>Clone graph</h2>

<h3>Statement</h3>

<p>
  Given a reference of a node in a
  <strong
    ><a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory)#Connected_graph"
      target="_blank"
      >connected</a
    ></strong
  >
  undirected graph.
</p>

<p>
  Return a
  <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy"
    target="_blank"
    ><strong>deep copy</strong></a
  >
  (clone) of the graph.
</p>

<p>
  Each node in the graph contains a value (<code>int</code>) and a list
  (<code>List[Node]</code>) of its neighbors.
</p>

<h3>Solution</h3>

<pre>
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List&lt;Node&gt; neighbors;
}
</pre>

<p>
  <b>An adjacency list</b> is a collection of unordered <b>lists</b> used to
  represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node
  in the graph.
</p>

<p>
  The given node will always be the first node with <code>val = 1</code>. You
  must return the <strong>copy of the given node</strong> as a reference to the
  cloned graph.
