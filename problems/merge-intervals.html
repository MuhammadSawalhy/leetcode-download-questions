<h4>Approach 1: Connected Components</h4>
<p><strong>Intuition</strong></p>
<p>
  If we draw a graph (with intervals as nodes) that contains undirected edges
  between all pairs of intervals that overlap, then all intervals in each
  <em>connected component</em> of the graph can be merged into a single
  interval.
</p>
<p><strong>Algorithm</strong></p>
<p>
  With the above intuition in mind, we can represent the graph as an adjacency
  list, inserting directed edges in both directions to simulate undirected
  edges. Then, to determine which connected component each node is in, we
  perform graph traversals from arbitrary unvisited nodes until all nodes have
  been visited. To do this efficiently, we store visited nodes in a
  <code>Set</code>, allowing for constant time containment checks and insertion.
  Finally, we consider each connected component, merging all of its intervals by
  constructing a new <code>Interval</code> with <code>start</code> equal to the
  minimum start among them and <code>end</code> equal to the maximum end.
</p>
<p>
  This algorithm is correct simply because it is basically the brute force
  solution. We compare every interval to every other interval, so we know
  exactly which intervals overlap. The reason for the connected component search
  is that two intervals may not directly overlap, but might overlap indirectly
  via a third interval. See the example below to see this more clearly.
</p>

</p>
<p>
  Although (1, 5) and (6, 10) do not directly overlap, either would overlap with
  the other if first merged with (4, 7). There are two connected components, so
  if we merge their nodes, we expect to get the following two merged intervals:

<p><strong>Complexity Analysis</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Time complexity : $O(n^2)$</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Building the graph costs $O(V + E) = O(V) + O(E) = O(n) + O(n^2) = O(n^2)$
  time, as in the worst case all intervals are mutually overlapping. Traversing
  the graph has the same cost (although it might appear higher at first) because
  our <code>visited</code> set guarantees that each node will be visited exactly
  once. Finally, because each node is part of exactly one component, the merge
  step costs $O(V) = O(n)$ time. This all adds up as follows:
</p>
<p>$$ O(n^2) + O(n^2) + O(n) = O(n^2) $$</p>
<ul>
  <li>Space complexity : $O(n^2)$</li>
</ul>
<p>
  As previously mentioned, in the worst case, all intervals are mutually
  overlapping, so there will be an edge for every pair of intervals. Therefore,
  the memory footprint is quadratic in the input size.

<h4>Approach 2: Sorting</h4>
<p><strong>Intuition</strong></p>
<p>
  If we sort the intervals by their <code>start</code> value, then each set of
  intervals that can be merged will appear as a contiguous "run" in the sorted
  list.
</p>
<p><strong>Algorithm</strong></p>
<p>
  First, we sort the list as described. Then, we insert the first interval into
  our <code>merged</code> list and continue considering each interval in turn as
  follows: If the current interval begins <em>after</em> the previous interval
  ends, then they do not overlap and we can append the current interval to
  <code>merged</code>. Otherwise, they do overlap, and we merge them by updating
  the <code>end</code> of the previous interval if it is less than the
  <code>end</code> of the current interval.
</p>
<p>
  A simple proof by contradiction shows that this algorithm always produces the
  correct answer. First, suppose that the algorithm at some point fails to merge
  two intervals that should be merged. This would imply that there exists some
  triple of indices $i$, $j$, and $k$ in a list of intervals $\text{ints}$ such
  that $i &lt; j &lt; k$ and ($\text{ints[i]}$, $\text{ints[k]}$) can be merged,
  but neither ($\text{ints[i]}$, $\text{ints[j]}$) nor ($\text{ints[j]}$,
  $\text{ints[k]}$) can be merged. From this scenario follow several
  inequalities:
</p>
<p>
  $$ \begin{aligned} \text{ints[i].end} &lt; \text{ints[j].start} \
  \text{ints[j].end} &lt; \text{ints[k].start} \ \text{ints[i].end} \geq
  \text{ints[k].start} \ \end{aligned} $$
</p>
<p>
  We can chain these inequalities (along with the following inequality, implied
  by the well-formedness of the intervals: $\text{ints[j].start} \leq
  \text{ints[j].end}$) to demonstrate a contradiction:
</p>
<p>
  $$ \begin{aligned} \text{ints[i].end} &lt; \text{ints[j].start} \leq
  \text{ints[j].end} &lt; \text{ints[k].start} \ \text{ints[i].end} \geq
  \text{ints[k].start} \end{aligned} $$
</p>
<p>
  Therefore, all mergeable intervals must occur in a contiguous run of the
  sorted list.
</p>
<p>
  <img
    alt="Sorting Example"
    src="https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/Figures/56/sort.png"
  />
</p>
<p>
  Consider the example above, where the intervals are sorted, and then all
  mergeable intervals form contiguous blocks.

class Solution {
public:
    vector&lt;vector&lt;int>> merge(vector&lt;vector&lt;int>>&amp; intervals) {
        sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end());

        vector&lt;vector&lt;int>> merged;
        for (auto interval : intervals) {
            // if the list of merged intervals is empty or if the current
            // interval does not overlap with the previous, simply append it.
            if (merged.empty() || merged.back()[1] &lt; interval[0]) {
                merged.push_back(interval);
            }
            // otherwise, there is overlap, so we merge the current and previous
            // intervals.
            else {
                merged.back()[1] = max(merged.back()[1], interval[1]);
            }
        }
        return merged;
    }
};</pre

<p><strong>Complexity Analysis</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Time complexity : $O(n\log{}n)$</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Other than the <code>sort</code> invocation, we do a simple linear scan of the
  list, so the runtime is dominated by the $O(n\log{}n)$ complexity of sorting.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Space complexity : $O(\log N)$ (or $O(n)$)</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If we can sort <code>intervals</code> in place, we do not need more than
  constant additional space, although the sorting itself takes $O(\log n)$
  space. Otherwise, we must allocate linear space to store a copy of
  <code>intervals</code> and sort that.
