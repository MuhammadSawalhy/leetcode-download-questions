<ul>
  <li>
    It is very easy to come up with a solution with a runtime of
    <code>O(n log n)</code>. Can you do it in linear time <code>O(n)</code> and
    possibly in a single pass?
  </li>
  <li>
    Can you do it without using any built-in function (i.e., like
    <code>__builtin_popcount</code> in C++)?

<h3>Hints</h3>

<ul>
  <li>You should make use of what you have produced already.</li>
  <li>
    Divide the numbers in ranges like [2-3], [4-7], [8-15] and so on. And try to
    generate new range from previous.
  </li>
  <li>
    Or does the odd/even status of the number help you in calculating the number
    of 1s?
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Editorial</h3>

<p>
  The problem asks us to count the number of set bits (1s) in the binary
  representation of each number from 0 to n. A naive approach would be to
  iterate from 0 to n and, for each number, count its set bits. This approach
  would have a time complexity of O(n log n) because counting bits for each
  number takes O(log n) time. However, the challenge asks for a linear time O(n)
  solution.
</p>

<p>
  We can achieve linear time complexity by using dynamic programming. The key
  idea is to use the already computed values to calculate the number of set bits
  for the current number. Observe that if a number is even, the number of set
  bits in it is the same as the number of set bits in its half (because dividing
  by 2 is equivalent to right-shifting by 1, which just removes a trailing 0).
  If a number is odd, the number of set bits in it is one more than the number
  of set bits in the number before it (because the last bit is a 1).
</p>

<p>
  Therefore, we can build an array <code>dp</code> of size n+1, where
  <code>dp[i]</code> stores the number of set bits in <code>i</code>. The base
  case is <code>dp[0] = 0</code>. Then, for each <code>i</code> from 1 to n, we
  check if <code>i</code> is even or odd. If <code>i</code> is even,
  <code>dp[i] = dp[i/2]</code>. If <code>i</code> is odd,
  <code>dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 1</code>. This approach computes the number of set
  bits for each number in O(1) time, resulting in an overall time complexity of
  O(n).

<h3>Solution</h3>
<pre>
 public class Solution {
  public int[] countBits(int n) {
   int[] ans = new int[n + 1];
   for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (i % 2 == 0) {
     ans[i] = ans[i / 2];
    } else {
     ans[i] = ans[i - 1] + 1;
    }
   }
   return ans;
  }
 }
